## Description

This repository contains an analysis of academic performance in a school district. The analysis explores various metrics, such as average math and reading scores, and the percentage of students passing math, reading, and both subjects. The goal is to identify patterns and trends related to school characteristics and student success.

## District Summary

The district summary provides a high-level snapshot of key metrics, including the total number of unique schools, total students, total budget, average math and reading scores, and the percentage of students passing math, reading, and both subjects.

## School Summary

The school summary delves into key metrics for each school, including school type, total students, total school budget, per student budget, average math and reading scores, and the percentage of students passing math, reading, and both subjects.

## Top Performing Schools

This section lists the top-performing schools based on the percentage of overall passing. It provides insights into the schools that excel in academic performance.

## Bottom Performing Schools

Conversely, this section lists the bottom-performing schools based on the percentage of overall passing. It highlights areas for potential improvement.

## Math and Reading Scores by Grade

These sections present average math and reading scores for students in each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th) across all schools.

## Scores by School Spending

The analysis categorizes schools based on average spending per student and examines the impact on academic performance. The results are presented in a table that breaks down school performance based on spending ranges.

## Scores by School Size

Similarly, the analysis categorizes schools based on size and explores how school size correlates with academic performance. The results are presented in a table that breaks down school performance based on size ranges.

## Scores by School Type

The analysis compares academic performance between charter and district schools. It explores how school type influences key metrics such as average scores and passing rates.

## Conclusion

The README provides a comprehensive overview of the analysis, including key findings and insights. It serves as a guide for understanding the structure of the repository and interpreting the results.
